react-startpage is a library that provides tools and components to facilitate the process of creating a browser start page.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```
npm i react-startpage
```

### Core concepts

Before you start working with react-startpage, you should be aware of the following core concepts the library uses:

- What are [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)?
- What is a [React context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)?
- Theming - Take a look at the `Theming` section of the documentation
- UI components - Take a look at the `How to use the UI components` section of the documentation

### Note

I recommend using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) with this library since its designed for this usecase. That being said, everything should work just fine without Emotion.
